# Marking Criteria
MARKING_CRITERIA = {
    "igcse_descriptive": """
Core Principle for Descriptive Marking: Marking is about identifying and rewarding strengths in a candidate's work. While weaknesses exist, the primary focus is on how well the work meets the established criteria, guiding the placement within the mark scheme by identifying what the candidate does achieve.
Descriptive essays are assessed on the candidate's ability to create an imaginative and effective piece of writing, judged on two distinct skills: Content and Structure (16 Marks) and Style and Accuracy (24 Marks).
A. Content and Structure (16 Marks): The "What" and "How It's Built"
This component focuses on the strength of the ideas, the development of the description, the creation of atmosphere, and the overall organization.
16-13 Marks (High Level: Compelling, Sophisticated, Excellent)
How Marks are Gained:
Compelling Description: The description is exceptionally vivid, original, and appeals strongly to multiple senses (e.g., sound, sight, smell, touch). It consistently creates a powerful and immersive atmosphere or mood.
Sophisticated Approach: Ideas are imaginative, fresh, and executed with originality, going beyond predictable or routine descriptions.
Excellent Organization: The structure is highly effective and sophisticated (e.g., starting with a specific detail and expanding, following a natural sensory progression). Transitions are seamless, leading to a logical progression of ideas and a sustained focus that captures and holds reader interest effortlessly throughout.
How Marks Can Be Limited/Deducted (within this band):
Minor predictability in one aspect of the description (moving from 16 to 15/14).
Description is strong but lacks extreme depth in one specific area (from 15 to 14).
Organization is excellent but has one very slight awkward transition (from 14 to 13).
12-9 Marks (Middle Level: Clear, Coherent, Good)
How Marks are Gained:
Clear and Effective Description: The description is coherent and effective, appealing to some senses. It generally captures the essence of the scene.
Good Engagement: The piece generally holds reader interest for most of the description.
Clear Organization: The structure is generally well-ordered, with a clear sense of beginning, middle, and end. Paragraphing is mostly effective, ensuring a logical progression of ideas.
How Marks Can Be Limited/Deducted:
A slight lack of originality or predictability in the descriptive approach (from 12 to 11/10).
Organization is logical but feels somewhat basic or conventional (from 10 to 9).
Engagement is good but not consistently high or powerful throughout (from 10 to 9).
A tendency to 'tell' the reader what the scene is like rather than consistently 'showing' it through evocative language (can push from 12 downwards).
8-5 Marks (Low Level: Basic, Limited Understanding)
How Marks are Gained:
Basic Description: Presents general observations and some details, primarily focusing on explicit, surface-level content.
Some Attempt at Structure: There is a rudimentary attempt at organizing ideas, perhaps with some paragraphing.
How Marks Can Be Limited/Deducted:
Description is very general, lacks specific detail, or appeals to few senses (from 8 to 7).
The piece may stray into narrative elements rather than maintaining a purely descriptive focus (from 7 to 6).
Organization is messy, making the description hard to follow or disjointed (from 6 to 5).
Engagement is very low; the piece might be bland or fail to create a distinct atmosphere (from 6 to 5).
4-1 Marks (Very Low Level: Minimal, Confused)
How Marks are Gained: Grasps only a few isolated descriptive points or attempts.
How Marks Can Be Limited/Deducted:
No discernible descriptive intent, or the account is rambling and incoherent.
Description is very generic or largely absent.
Organization is chaotic; ideas are jumbled with no logical structure.
Completely fails to interest the reader or create any atmosphere.
B. Style and Accuracy (24 Marks): The "Language Execution"
This component assesses the quality of the language used (vocabulary, sentence structures, narrative techniques) and the level of technical correctness.
24-20 Marks (High Level: Sophisticated, Highly Controlled, Accurate)
How Marks are Gained:
Sophisticated & Precise Vocabulary: Employs a wide, rich, and highly nuanced range of vocabulary, chosen with precision for powerful and deliberate effect. Language is consistently fresh, imaginative, and original.
Highly Varied Sentence Structures: Demonstrates masterful control of complex and varied sentence types. Structures are manipulated skillfully to control pace, rhythm, and emphasis, and to convey sophisticated meaning. Syntax is consistently flawless.
Virtually Error-Free: Spelling, punctuation, and grammar are consistently accurate. Any errors are extremely minor, isolated, and do not impede meaning in any way.
Masterful Descriptive Techniques: Consistently uses strong, original imagery, powerful figurative language (e.g., unique metaphors/similes), vivid sensory details, and an outstanding ability to 'show' rather than 'tell.' Evokes a strong, sustained atmosphere.
How Marks Can Be Limited/Deducted (within this band):
A rare, isolated awkward phrasing or extremely minor grammatical slip (from 24 to 23/22).
Vocabulary is sophisticated but perhaps not consistently impactful or truly unique throughout the entire piece (from 22 to 21/20).
Descriptive techniques are strong but perhaps not every single one is executed with maximum effect or originality (from 21 to 20).
19-14 Marks (Middle Level: Effective, Clear, Competent)
How Marks are Gained:
Good Vocabulary: The vocabulary is clear, accurate, and generally varied. There are noticeable attempts at more sophisticated or vivid word choices.
Varied Sentence Structures: Attempts to use different sentence structures, showing some complexity. Structures are generally effective and contribute to the flow.
Mostly Accurate: Errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar are present but are generally minor and do not significantly impede meaning. The overall meaning remains clear.
Effective Descriptive Techniques: Uses some imagery and sensory details, showing instances of 'showing' rather than 'telling.' Figurative language may be present and generally effective, though perhaps less original or consistently impactful than in higher levels; may include some acceptable clichés.
How Marks Can Be Limited/Deducted:
Noticeable repetition in vocabulary or sentence structures (from 19 to 17/16).
More frequent minor errors, or occasional errors that cause brief ambiguity in meaning (from 17 to 15/14).
Descriptive techniques are present but not consistently effective or may sometimes be clichéd (from 16 to 14).
A few awkward sentences or grammatical errors that momentarily disrupt flow (from 15 to 14).
13-8 Marks (Low Level: Adequate, Basic, Some Errors)
How Marks are Gained:
Basic Vocabulary: The range of vocabulary is restricted, often simple and repetitive.
Simple Sentence Structures: Predominantly uses simple sentences, with limited variety.
Some Accuracy: Shows a basic grasp of spelling, punctuation, and grammar, though errors are frequent.
How Marks Can Be Limited/Deducted:
Vocabulary may be used inaccurately or awkwardly (from 13 to 11/10).
Errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar are frequent, and they may sometimes impede meaning or cause awkwardness (from 13 to 11/10).
Reliance on very basic sentence structures without much variety (from 11 to 9/8).
Minimal or ineffective use of descriptive techniques; heavy reliance on "telling" rather than showing; figurative language may be clumsy or nonsensical (from 10 to 8).
7-1 Marks (Very Low Level: Very Limited, Serious Errors)
How Marks are Gained: Shows minimal linguistic attempt.
How Marks Can Be Limited/Deducted:
Extremely basic vocabulary with severe repetition.
Sentences are often incomprehensible or grammatically incorrect.
Errors are so frequent and severe that the writing is largely unintelligible.
No attempt at imagery or effective language.
Mark this text based on the above criteria: Do not over-scrutinize, marks can be awarded positively and negatively. Try to limit marks when mistakes are made


SPECIFIC FOCUS AREAS - Where you, the AI, consistently makes mistakes while marking:

Bad vocabulary, if the essay does not consistently display good vocabulary and flow, do not mark it higher than 27. But please think if it does or does not. And you do not always need to mark it 27

You give high marks to narratives, narratives and descriptives are not similar, please ensure high marking descriptives have descriptive qualities, and don't focus on a plot, it may have one, but the plot isn't the essay's focus. Instead the focus should be vocabulary, imagery and the six senses. Please focus you improvements feedback on those. 

The feedback is random, and not relevant to what it actually should be. I will give you examples of proper marking, so you know feedback should be.

You tend to be a little harsh in marking descriptives, please bear that in mind, if the essay has good descriptive and sophisticated vocabulary, consider marking it higher than 30. PROBLEM IS now you think that all essays deserve 30+, no this is not the case. You have to think if the essay is good or not. Just pointing out you harsh does not mean you always should be lenient.
"Write a description with the title, "A moment of stillness'.

Moment of Stillness

Rising gently and torpidly across the azure sky, the sun’s rays gilded everything they could touch, creating a misty sheen that danced over rooftops and dew-laden leaves. A soft golden haze drifted through silent streets, casting long, limpid shadows beneath swirling branches, bathing the waking world in an ethereal glow.
I peered closer at the bustling road, iridescent colors shimmering in the light. At the same moment, the sound of cars swished by in the air, like bees buzzing loudly by.
A faint scent of a baker’s hard work paid off drifted across the breeze, as the freshly baked pastries clung to my memory like my childhood Christmas cookies. My tongue could taste the cool early morning. Occasionally, pedestrians would plod by the sides of the roads, persevering through the scorching heat. A cacophony of tweeting and tooting filled the atmosphere, as the world around me seemed to never end and kept functioning as if it were clockwork.
Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted as rain poured down heavily, ringing like a wake-up call to all passing by on the road. Alongside it came a pungent smell of dirt, heavily drifting through the air, altering the mood as it lingered by. Umbrellas populated the scene as people rushed to hide under canopies of trees and dashed inside nearby buildings. Under my fingers, the rain felt cool and tantalizing, giving the place a new look. 
The clock ticked endlessly. The rain soon faded away. The road was now bare; nothing passed by in the desolate atmosphere. It was as if the rain had calmed the pandemonium. A single candy wrapper skittered across the roadway, and a lone bird whirled around a lamppost.
I felt at serenity, my heart beating gently, caught between stillness and quietude in that instant. The ineffable moment was soothing as I inhaled a deep breath, lingering in the moment.
As the sun lowered beyond the horizon, the entire landscape transformed. Warm hues of rose and copper settled like a cozy fire in the stillness. The road held the echo of earlier warmth, and I stood witnessing the soft decline of light, the world draped in tranquility, a contented hush as night approached. The world whispered in its frenzy, reminding me that even in the heart of chaos, stillness waits — quiet, unwavering, and full of grace — just begging to be seen"

This is what the feedback should look like, ignore the casual tone and the casual language, focus on the feedback:

this is well written.
content-wise,
the response is relevant to ur prompt, which is a moment of stillness. there are clear attempts at imagery such as the sights, sounds, smells etc and the structure flows chronologically/in a sensible manner. there is effort to also move the response from calm, to bustling, then to calm again, which shows variety.
although there are some minor inconsistencies: the transition to the rainy atmosphere feels rushed imo, and feels a little narrative-like asw, as if ur reporting a sudden change in the weather. instead of just saying the atmosphere shifted, you could much rather imply or describe it, such as "gloomy grey clouds began to block out the sun's iridescent rays, the atmosphere darkening suddenly as the soft pitter-patter of raindrops fell upon the bustling cityscape" (etc). 

quality-wise,
your vocab is ambitious and accurately used. there is a variety in sentence structure, avoiding monotony and attempting to keep the flow intact. the uses of similes and/or metaphors are effective in some places such as "ringing like a wake-up call".

although, inconsistencies here as well. a major one is a salient contradiction- "my tongue could taste the cool early morning" followed immediately by a contradicting sentence "persevering through the scorching heat" which breaks flow and confuses the reader. smaller inconsistencies like the use of "limpid shadows" also tend to be odd- "limpid" is generally associated with being transparent and clear, like water, and using it to describe a shadow does not make a lot of sense; it seems more confusing than clever. there is repetition of the word moment sometimes, which seems redundant such as in the sentence "ineffable moment was soothing...lingering in the moment". im not sure about the phrase "scent of a baker's hard work paid off" since to me it sounds odd and awkward.

13/16 for content + 19/24 for quality = 32/40 overall

SPECIFIC FOCUS AREAS - Deduct heavily for:

Predictable series of events (-3): "Reformed bully excels instantly, becomes superhero cop" type narratives that offer no complexity or tension; single events (like exam results) becoming sole proof of character change.
Gaps and implausibilities (-3): Major time periods glossed over (e.g., "three-year training to be sub-inspector"), unrealistic declarations (e.g., crime eradication "within two years… completely")—both undercut credibility.
Ending is sudden and incomplete (-3): Characters left in transitional states without resolution (e.g., "anxious at airport" with promised climax never reached), leaving no resolution or final reflection.
Limited atmosphere and sensory engagement (-3): Setting is functional rather than vivid; lacks immersive qualities.

Deduct for:

Plot is too simple or predictable (from 8 to 7).
Characterization is very basic (from 7 to 6).

Deduct for:

Increasing levels of confusion, irrelevance, or incoherence.

0 Marks: No creditable resp onse.

B. Style and Accuracy (24 Marks): The "Language Execution"

Key Discriminators & How to Award/Deduct Marks:
24-20 Marks (High Level: Sophisticated, Highly Controlled, Accurate)
Award for:

Sophisticated & Precise Vocabulary: Wide range, accurate, nuanced, used for powerful and deliberate effect. Fresh, imaginative word choices.
Highly Varied Sentence Structures: Excellent control of complex and varied sentence types. Controls pace, rhythm, and emphasis with skill.
Virtually Error-Free: Spelling, punctuation, and grammar are consistently accurate. Any errors are negligible and do not impede meaning.
Masterful Narrative/Descriptive Techniques: Consistently uses strong imagery, powerful figurative language (original metaphors/similes), sensory details, and 'showing' rather than 'telling.' Evokes strong atmosphere.

Deduct for:

A rare, isolated awkward phrasing or very minor grammatical slip (from 24 to 23/22).
Vocabulary is sophisticated but not consistently impactful or truly unique (from 22 to 21/20).
Techniques are strong but perhaps not every single one is executed with maximum effect (from 21 to 20).

19-14 Marks (Middle Level: Effective, Clear, Competent)
Award for:

Good Vocabulary: Clear, accurate, and generally varied. Some attempts at more sophisticated or vivid words.
Varied Sentence Structures: Attempts at different structures, some complexity, generally effective but may sometimes be repetitive or slightly awkward.
Mostly Accurate: Errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar are present but generally minor and do not significantly impede meaning. Meaning is clear.

Award for:

Basic Vocabulary: Restricted range, often simple and repetitive. May use words inaccurately or awkwardly.
Simple Sentence Structures: Predominantly simple sentences, lacking variety. May contain grammatical errors.
Frequent Errors: Errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar are frequent. They may sometimes impede meaning or cause awkwardness.
Minimal/Ineffective Techniques: Little to no evidence of specific narrative/descriptive techniques, or their use is clumsy/nonsensical. Heavy reliance on "telling."

SPECIFIC FOCUS AREAS - Deduct heavily for:

Repetition and bland diction (-4): "Because/because", "very", "extremely", "simply"—removes dynamism and impact from prose.
Over-reliance on very short, declarative sentences (-4): Little sentence variety to control pace or mood; monotonous rhythm.
Techniques: no figurative language, sensory details or fresh imagery (-4): Exposition equals telling throughout; lacks literary sophistication.
Minor errors noted but not heavily penalized: Punctuation slips (missing commas after introductory phrases, occasional capitalisation quirks); none impede meaning.
Overall assessment: Serviceable but functional prose anchored in the low–middle band.

No Narrative/Descriptive Features: No attempt at imagery or effective language.

Deduct for:

Increasing levels of unintelligibility and grammatical breakdown.

0 Marks: No creditable response.

WHERE YOU, THE AI, GOES WRONG IN MARKING:

1. Deduction of too many marks for "less insight on the characters" if you're thinking: "The student should have added a brief paragraph to explain the characters/plot more". Stop thinking that, this isn't needed and please do not deduct many marks for this.
2. You tend to be a little harsh in marking narratives, please bear that in mind, if the essay has good narrative qualities and sophisticated vocabulary, consider marking it higher than 30. PROBLEM IS now you think that all essays deserve 30+, no this is not the case. You have to think if the essay is good or not. Just pointing out you harsh does not mean you always should be lenient. 
2. Deduction of too many marks for diction consistency, please focus on spellings, grammar, tenses and vocabulary more. Do not deduct for "Verify Diction"
3. Way too many marks for essays that are not even narratives, I gave an essay that was an IGCSE writers effect that had words like "In Paragraph 3, the writer effectively uses imagery, metaphor and personification to convey meaning and to create effects" this is clearly not a narrative, narratives have plot, characters etc. Essays that explain effects of narratives are not narratives and are worth 0
4. Your feedback is random, and not relevant to what it actually should be. I will give you examples of proper marking, so you know feedback should be.

"Two years after they last saw eachother, I was amazed at how confident he seemed. It wasn't just the way he held himself, taller and broader than I remembered, but the quiet assurance in his eyes. The last time I saw Knox, he was a gangly boy with a shy smile, leaving me with a tearful hug and the promise of a daily video call. That promise had faded after a month, and with it, our connection had dissolved into silence.
Now, standing in the bustling hallway of our high school, he was no longer that boy. He was Knox, but different. His smile, though just as warm, held a new maturity that made my heart ache. I watched him, a little stunned at his easy manner, wondering if he even remembered me. When we finally had a moment alone, the quiet question of his silence lingered between us. He explained his old phone had gotten lost in the chaotic move to Germany, and with it, all his contacts. He showed me the new number scrawled on a piece of paper in his wallet.
Reconciliation came easily, like slipping into an old, comfortable sweater. On a crisp autumn afternoon, we walked to the park where we had spent countless hours as children. He led me to a large oak tree, gesturing towards a half-buried shoebox. It was our time capsule. We dug it up, the dirt clinging to the worn cardboard. Inside were two folded sheets of notebook paper. On one, in my looping handwriting, was a list of ten things I wanted to do before we graduated. On the other, in his bold scrawl, was his own list. A plan was formed through our shared smiles: we would do them all, together.
And so we did. November and the weeks that followed were a whirlwind of adventure. We built a blanket fort in my living room, had a ten-movie marathon, learned to make a terrible but hilarious soufflé, and went stargazing in the middle of a field. Every completed task brought us closer, our old bond transforming into something deeper.

By the end of December, our lists were almost complete. We had one thing left each. The final items were a silent pact, a private ambition for each of us. We planned to do our last two tasks the next day, our grand finale before the end of the year. But the next day, Knox didn't show up to school. A wave of dread washed over me, but i told myself he must have slept in. My phone rang, it was his mom.
I rushed to the hospital in a blur of fear. The sterile scent of antiseptic filled my lungs, a sharp contrast to the gentle autumn air outside. I found him in a room, his face pale against the white pillow, a network of tubes and wires connecting him to beeping machines. He looked small, so small, and when our eyes met, the confident boy from the hallway was gone replaced by the vulnerable friend he once was.
"I have cancer."
My world narrowed to the small, white room, the beeping of the machines now deafening. Tears streamed silently down my face as he explained that his dad's job had been a lie, a cover story for the move to Germany to get specialized treatment. The quiet confidence I had admired was not confidence at all, but a boy trying to live a full life in the time he had left. His silence was a shield, a desperate attempt to protect me from the pain.
With trembling hands, he passed me his list, and I, with hands that shook even more, gave him mine. We didn't read them aloud, but our eyes scanned the final words on each page. A shared, heartbreaking smile passed between us, a silent acknowledgement of a secret we had both kept, now revealed. My heart ached as we talked not about the future, but about everything we had done together, the adventures of the last month a beautiful memory against the harsh reality of the room. I stayed by his side, holding his hand, the warmth of it fading slowly, so slowly, until all that was left was the cold reality of loss. I leaned forward, a single tear escaping my eye, and kissed him on the forehead, just a small peck. The kiss completed the last thing on both of our lists.

This is what the feedback should look like, ignore the casual tone and the casual language, focus on the feedback:

ean style of writing, well developed plot for the word count, and good vocabulary to follow asw 
the task is fulfilled very well, the engagement is also definitely there and the undertone of romance adds to the overall endearment
the structure is well done, cohesive and not seeming out of place anywhere, and the time capsule/bucket list idea drives it away from being a cliche romance story
if i were to be a little stringent, the smallest issues were where i found the plot to be slightly abruptly developed, esp in the part where knox's illness is revealed

vocabulary wise, except for the slip in the first line itself "two years after they last saw each other, I" .." the description, the style, the tone, the accuracy and the overall structure is very well done. youve utilised your skills to their potential and its visible here, and everything seems incredibly cohesive and generally well written asw

14/16 + 21/24 = 35/40 would be my mark for this one! a solid high band without a doubt ngl

Middle mark essay example: One morning, my friend: Mark and I, stood upon the rusted gates. In front of it, lies two statues coated in moss and cracks here and there — yet they felt alive, as if they were the guarding something important yet forgotten. As our curiosity drove us toward, I slowly opened the gate. As we went inside, in front of us, stood an old, abandoned mansion. There were myths that treasures lay underneath it, although no one has ever dared come close to it. Despite it being filled with such uncovered mysteries, two teenagers: Mark and I — just the two of us, standing at the front door of it. Mark grabbed the doorknob and carefully opened the long aged wooden door. As it creaks, a sudden wave of chilly breeze, washed over us, forming up shivers all over the body. 

We took our first step into the first room: the living room. The wooden flooring moaned painfully each time we stepped on it. The earthy air filled with old paper scent. The furniture scattered everywhere, as if some unthinkable chaos has occurred centuries ago. Its stuffs torn apart, coated in layers of dust and the moss swallowing up, as if the nature has consumed it. Above it, lies a magnificent chandelier: which was once a grand shinning one which only the wealthy could afford. Along with it, stood a fireplace, by the carvings on it, we could sure tell that it was indeed a masterpiece of its maker. Despite the fame it once had, now covered in vines, its firewood, already turned into ashes. Mark and I couldn't say a word as we were keep getting attacked by surprises.
After it, there was a hallway that stretched all the way inside, as if there was no end to it. Its path, dressed with carpet. Its colour, unable to tell as it had been washed away by our nature, leaving a pale grey look to it. We followed along the hall. There were portraits hanging on the wall unevenly, with each doors locked. We could not see clearly the persons inside anymore, some worn to shreds and some with parts missing. Our desire to explore the unknown, pushed us further inside. We marched in while looking at those portraits. Then, after a moment Mark stopped. He said "Hey! come look at this one over here!". I quickly walked near him. By the time I looked what Mark was showing, I gasped in shock — it was a girl, a young girl in the portrait, with its pictures untouched by the nature. Despite coated in dust, we could clearly see her! Yet her hallow eyes taunted us. Beside it, was a door unlocked and slightly opened. We exchanged glances and gulped, and I gently opened the door. Again, an icing cold air wrapped us. 

Behind it, lay a staircase, leading down below. We had to gather our courage and stepped down there. Beneath it, was a single room which isn't big yet too small. There was only a light bulb hang on the ceiling, producing a dim light. I was nervous; my hands trembling. A feeling of dread gradually took over us. There was a crate on the floor. I had a really off feeling about it yet I was too slow to tell it — Mark had already opened it. Suddenly we heard a loud slam behind us, we looked back immediately — the door was shut. Then, the light started flickering, and darkness wrapping around — shadows stretched unnaturally. In a blink of an eye, it became pitch black — every sound got chased away. After a few hours — or so it seemed, I slowly came back to my senses, I was lying in front of the gates. I ran at full speed back to my house as I knew that — I had to say something.
Yet years have passed by, there is still not a single track of Mark. Many people didn't believe me and accused that I murdered my friend, but in my heart, I knew — I knew that he had been restrained by the mansion, and he might still be in there — alive, but trapped.

This is what the feedback should look like, ignore the casual tone and the casual language, focus on the feedback:

this is a little rocky. 
the plot itself is decently well done, and content wise, there is a strong atmosphere and description, with a suspenseful progression of the narrative and a hook because of the opening that immediately sets the mystery. 
there are many awkward phrased that disrupt flow and structure, such as "we were keep getting attacked by surprises" which is incorrect. furthermore, character development for mark is missing. we know barely anything about him, so a reader may not be obliged to feel much emotion on mark's disappearance. also your ending was quite abrupt. could have beeen smoothly tightened instead of "the years have passed"
and hence your mark for content out of 16 is 12.

quality of writing is where it starts to fall apart. although there is good use of imagery and frequent usage of ambitious vocabulary in places, there are a lot of grammatical errors, tense slips, and repetitions.
for example your narrative is in past tense but there is a repeated mistake made of suddenly introducing present tense in the wrong context such as "As it creaks," "above it lies," "a single room which isn't too big yet too small".
furthermore, there are many grammatical slips: "its stuffs torn", "were keep getting attacked by surprises", "an icing cold air", "too big yet too small", etc 
there is significant repetition of the phrase "Mark an I" in the first paragraph in places that are unnecessary, and the "cold air" bit is redundant with the double repetition.
many punctuation errors also significantly impact the flow and cohesiveness of the response. 
all of these errors have a significant impact on meaning and flow, and hence drag the quality of the response itself down.
for writing out of 24, this is a 15.


IV. FINAL MARK ALLOCATION
Once both components are marked, add them together for a total out of 40.
The final assessment should justify the total mark by summarizing the strengths and weaknesses for each component, making direct reference to specific examples from the candidate's work and linking them to the level descriptors.
Mark this text based on the above criteria: Do not over-scrutinize, marks can be awarded positively and negatively. Heavily limit marks when endings are rushed/not good. Please don't call every essay a rushed ending, do remember there is a word limit, however, rushed endings will cause heavy deduction of marks.""",

Common Examiner Deductions and Error Patterns

Major Reading Deductions:
Excessive lifting or copying from original texts without own words adaptation results in 3 to 5 mark deductions. Failure to address implicit meanings or attitudes drops candidates to Level 3 maximum. Missing evaluation component limits responses to Level 4 maximum. Irrelevant or invented content not derived from texts results in significant mark loss.

Major Writing Deductions:
Inappropriate register for specified audience reduces writing marks by 2 to 4 marks. Over-reliance on original text vocabulary and phrasing limits Level 3 maximum achievement. Poor structural organization with weak opening or closing results in 1 to 3 mark deductions. Persistent grammar errors that impede communication drop candidates below Level 4.

Format-Specific Requirements – Expanded Guidance

Candidates are required to write in a specified format such as a speech, letter, or article. The format must be adhered to strictly as it influences tone, style, structure, and language features. Familiarity with conventions of each format is essential for a high-scoring response.

General Examiner Notes on Format Adherence

    Failure to adhere to the prescribed format results in mark penalties, usually limiting top-level achievement in writing.

    Candidates repeating phrases or phrasing directly from passage texts instead of producing original writing tailored to the format lose marks.

    Format features must permeate both content and language rather than appearing only superficially (e.g., a letter must also sound like a letter, not just begin with Dear...).

    Creativity and originality are rewarded, provided responses align with format conventions and audience expectations.

    Consistency throughout the piece in tone, register, and structural markers signals strong command of the chosen format.

    Purpose 
	

Devices and techniques to demonstrate you understand the purpose of the task

Write to explain:

    “Explain your point of view about…”

    “Explain your attitude to…”

    “Explain your thoughts on…”

	

    Provide reasons for your ideas

    Offer examples and anecdotes:

        Use imagery to describe experiences 

    Provide facts and statistics:

        In the exam you can use those provided in the reading texts     

    Use present-tense verbs:

        Usually you are explaining about something that is currently the case

    Use either first or third person consistently

Use appropriate connectives:

    Words like “Moreover”, “Furthermore”, “However” and “On the other hand” provide cohesion and fluency

Write to argue:

    “Argue your point of view about…”

    “Give your views on…”

    Write in the first person as you are putting forward your thoughts and opinions

    Use personal and inclusive pronouns:

        Using words like “we” and “us” builds rapport between you and your reader and makes them feel involved 

    Present your opinions as facts - as a truth that shouldn’t be challenged

    Be persuasive and passionate about your argument, but not aggressive:

        Readers do not respond well to an aggressive tone

    Use emotive language and rhetorical questions to persuade your reader of the validity of your argument

    You can present both sides of an argument, but decide on your position and maintain it throughout:

        This means that you can start your counter-argument with phrases such as “While I acknowledge that some people might think…”

        Then circle back to your original position

Write to persuade:

    “Persuade the audience of your point of view about…”

    Use imperatives to call your audience to action

    Use rhetorical techniques such as the rule of three to convince the reader of your argument

    Decide on your position or opinion and stick to it throughout

    Avoid sounding like an advertisement


Where, you the AI, consistently make mistakes while marking:

Please understand that it is crucial feedback if a student writes in a different format than what is expected in the question, it shouldn't be penalised too much, only a little, but should be explained in the improvement suggestions
The word limit does not matter too much, it is not a factor in the marking, so don't penalise the student for writing a lot. Please penalise the student for writing too little, it is a factor in the marking if the the low amount of words directly affects the number of points/ideas in the essay


Critical Success Indicators

High-Level Reading Performance:
Goes beyond surface identification to evaluate effectiveness of arguments. Demonstrates understanding of writers' intentions and implicit attitudes. Synthesizes ideas from both texts to create coherent response. Uses textual evidence judiciously without excessive quotation or lifting.

High-Level Writing Performance:
Maintains consistent, appropriate register throughout response. Creates engaging opening that hooks reader attention. Develops ideas logically with smooth transitions between paragraphs. Uses sophisticated vocabulary precisely and effectively. Concludes with impact, leaving lasting impression on reader.

Automatic Mark Limitations:
Responses that ignore specified format requirements cannot exceed Level 4 for writing. Excessive copying or lifting prevents achievement above Level 3 for reading. Failure to address both bullet points in task limits overall response quality. Word count significantly outside 250 to 350 range may indicate poor planning and affect both reading and writing assessment.

Speech Format & Example Marking

    Purpose: Often to inform, persuade, motivate, or entertain an audience in a live or virtual setting.

    Audience Awareness: Must directly address the audience using second-person pronouns (e.g., "you," "we"), inclusive language ("together," "our community"), and rhetorical devices to engage listeners.

    Opening: Needs a strong, attention-grabbing introduction (e.g., a rhetorical question, dramatic statement, or anecdote) to hook the audience quickly.

    Tone: Should reflect the context—formal or informal—but must maintain engagement and appropriate energy or passion throughout.

    Structure: Clear signposting and transitions are critical. Use of phrases like "Firstly," "Furthermore," and "In conclusion" help guide listeners.

    Techniques: Use of repetition, rhetorical questions, anecdotes, emotive language, and pauses or commands enhances persuasive effect.

    Closing: Memorable and motivating calls to action or a summary statement encouraging reflection or decision-making.

    Marking Focus: Examiners specifically look for the ability to connect with an audience, clarity of purpose, and use of features unique to spoken performance.

    Marking Scheme points:

    Thank you for coming to listen to me today on the topic of whether students should participate in decisions about our school. As you are aware, we currently do not have a school council, which I believe denies us the opportunity to influence how our school is run.

The effectiveness of student participation, such as through school councils, depends on how well this is managed. If a school does not value students' feedback, then having a council is pointless. If I was a representative and I put a lot of time and effort into the role, I would want my opinions to be heard and acknowledged. In these cases, students would end up feeling disillusioned and without any power.

I can also appreciate the fact that parents, in both fee-paying and non-fee-paying schools, would expect the school to put education first, and leave the big decisions to those entrusted with running the school in the first place. However, this, in my opinion, is short-sighted. We should be empowered to make informed decisions about the place where we spend most of our time. Just because we are young, this does not mean we are incapable of making good decisions and providing good feedback.

Having student representation in a school can bring real benefits to both the school and its students. We can feel valued, and develop life skills such as communication, negotiation and decision-making. Being a student representative looks good on our application forms and CVs, and students can offer fresh perspectives on challenging issues, such as bullying. When students are given more responsibility, this can result in better attitudes, better attendance and better results.

As part of my preparation for this speech, I read a guide for teachers on setting up school councils, and I did wonder how realistic this guide was in terms of the amount of time and commitment a school council requires from its members. This guide only talked about the benefits, and while I do believe we need student representation in this school, I think this has to be balanced and well-considered. I think the most effective type of participation is one in which pupils have a real say on the real issues that affect our school. For this to work, it will take real commitment. But ultimately I believe that we should be trusted with the responsibility of shaping the course of our own education, and a school council would be one of the ways in which we can do this.

Thank you for listening.

Please follow the example marking for the speech above, do not focus on the format, but focus on the feedback.

    The speech starts as instructed and demonstrates an understanding of the task, its purpose and intended audience

    The introduction establishes a clear voice and point of view

    Ideas and opinions from both texts are implied in the response

    The response uses conventions of a speech, such as inclusive pronouns and direct address, to connect to the audience

    Below are the opening paragraphs of a student response to a directed writing task. The prompt required candidates to compose a letter in response to an article discussing screen time among young people.

   Example of a Weak IGCSE English Directed Writing Response: Dear Digital Trends,

Your magazine made an article recently called "Are screens scrambling our kids' brains?" and I thought it was interesting. But, there were some problems with it, too. Let me explain. 

The article talks about how kids should only use tech for two hours a day. The reason is because if they used technology too much they could end up becoming overweight somehow. But the problem is that the source for this information is old and that means it is probably out of date and not that useful anymore for us. The study's not even really about technology at all so why quote it? It should really be up to the parents to decide anyway.

The issues with this response are quite obvious. The response lacks the correct format of a formal letter. There are no addresses listed, nor is there a subject line. Additionally, the language is far too informal. Beginning a sentence with 'but' can be appropriate for informal writing, however, it is not when composing a letter to a magazine. Moreover, the rhetorical question is poorly executed and the use of contractions is not recommended. 

Example of a Strong IGCSE English Directed Writing Response: Dear Digital Trends, 

Your recently published article, entitled "Are screens scrambling our kids' brains?" posed a number of interesting arguments. However, there are certain issues that should be raised with regard to this article. 

The article writes how the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) recommends maximum two hours of entertainment screen time daily. This is a reasonable statement as there is a relationship between excessive screen time and obesity. However, it should be noted that the AAP's study is 25 years old and focused on nutrition in children rather than technology's impact. Thus, to reference it with regard to the negative influence technology can have on younger people is somewhat disingenuous. Ultimately, the recommendation that screen time be limited to two hours is sound with regard to younger children, yet may need to be revised by parents as their child grows. This is because older children increasingly use devices for socialising and may be more mature in handling their content consumption. 

Here, readers can see a response worthy of higher markers. The format of a letter is properly adhered to in this extract. Moreover, the tone and language is far more appropriate. The writer's authorial voice is commanding and speaks to a confidence that aids in achieving higher marks.""",

Article Format

    Purpose: To inform, entertain, or persuade readers in a magazine, newsletter, or website setting.

    Audience: Readers of the publication, generally a more general audience than letter recipients, requiring accessible but engaging language.

    Introduction: Engaging opening paragraph that introduces the topic clearly and hooks readers.

    Body Paragraphs: Well-developed with clear topic sentences, supporting details, explanations, and evidence whether factual or anecdotal.

"
Small change – big difference?

It has never been more critical to tackle the climate change issue, and yet some would argue that individual action is meaningless. Some critics would scoff at our Knightsbridge High water bottles, roll their eyes at our school allotment, and dismiss our move to electric school buses with a wave of their hand. Yet I know that students, parents, and teachers passionately feel that our small changes can make a big difference to our planet.

Though there is an issue with the commercialisation of green issues, that doesn't mean we should give up entirely. If large corporations want to cash in on recycling and protecting endangered animals to improve their brand image, it still promotes awareness of these issues. True, the problem comes when individuals buy from a so-called green company and then think they've done enough and don't need to act any more, but our community isn't built of "lazy environmentalists". What's lazier than doing nothing at all? Most young people do care and want to get involved; if 76% of people buy products for the environment, doesn't that show eagerness to get involved? Isn't it better to harness the will of people who want to help but don't yet know how to do it efficiently rather than mock them for being part of the capitalist machine?

Schools are the perfect place to begin cultivating the global citizens of tomorrow. Nowhere can collective action be made more evident than in a school, as we see that each of us individuals form classes, and our classes form year groups, and year groups form a high school with over 1,000 passionate students. Knightsbridge could start a campaign to raise awareness of climate issues, such as the impact of meat on the environment and the dangers of reliance on fossil fuels. After all, we've introduced Meat Free Mondays! Imagine not just our 1,000 current students becoming ambassadors of these issues but the network of people we will interact with throughout our lives, from future friends we've not yet met to workmates at the successful careers we're all surely destined for.

Through our Global Citizenship lessons, we have all learned that truly impactful change comes from a governmental level. Just think of banning CFC chemicals, which were destroying our Ozone, or reducing acid rain through cutting emissions. Yet we must realise that governments and corporations are also formed from people – and it could be us as leaders of the future! Not only that, but we also have the power to influence these entities by lobbying the government or choosing which party we vote for at elections. We shouldn't act helpless as though these institutions are entirely out of our influence.

Ultimately, tackling this impending climate disaster will take hard work, but it's not a luxury to decide whether to get involved or not: it is our duty, our moral imperative, to save our planet. If not us, then who? As the younger generation, no one has more to lose than us. Now is not the time to give up hope. Now is the time to understand that saving this planet will require individual and collective effort – it's not either/or.

Let's encourage our prefects, teachers, school leaders and parents to invest not just in their children's educations but into the very planet that sustains our ability to breathe clean air, admire cerulean skies, and accomplish our dreams beyond the present day… together"

Writing Marks 25/25:

Your examiner will assess you for writing by identifying the following features:

    ____   Underline any SPAG errors or expression issues
    V   for impressive vocab
    R   for effective register that sounds like a student magazine

Candidate writes with consistent accuracy and ambition in both vocabulary choices and sentence structures. A sophisticated style with flair, capable of expressing abstract ideas. Paragraphs are structured by argument and build to a conclusion. Register is effective for a school magazine article.""",
    "igcse_writers_effect": """
This guide details how marks are gained and lost in Question 2(d), focusing on the critical assessment of a candidate's ability to analyze a writer's use of language to convey meaning and create effect.
Core Principles:
Holistic Marking: The overall quality of the response, particularly the analysis of effect, is paramount.
Quality over Quantity: Depth and precision in analysis are valued more than the sheer number of points or words chosen.
Focus on Effect: The primary goal is to explain how the writer's language choices impact the reader, convey meaning, or create a specific mood/atmosphere, not just to define words or describe literal actions.
Source-Bound: Analysis must be firmly rooted in the provided text; do not introduce external information or speculation.
Ignore Inaccurate Statements: Marks are not deducted for inaccurate statements; they are simply ignored.
Marking Levels (Recap):
Level 5 (13-15 marks): Judicious selection of best examples, wide range of techniques identified, precise explanation of effects, significant depth in analysis.
Level 4 (10-12 marks): Good selection, clear explanations, some range of techniques, some depth in analysis.
Level 3 (7-9 marks): Adequate selection, basic explanations of effects, limited range of techniques.
Level 2 (4-6 marks): Some relevant choices, simple explanations, often literal or very general.
Level 1 (1-3 marks): Limited choices, minimal explanation, often just identifying phrases with no or incorrect analysis of effect.

I. Where Marks Are Gained
Marks are primarily gained through the quality of selection and analysis of effect.
Judicious and Relevant Selection:


Choosing powerful, unusual, or vivid words and phrases that offer rich opportunities for analysis.
Selecting phrases that genuinely carry connotations beyond their literal meaning.
Ensuring choices include imagery as requested (e.g., metaphors, similes, personification).
Insight from Real Marking: Even partial choices can be considered "potentially relevant" if the chosen segment has some inherent meaning, though this limits the potential for higher marks.
Clear and Precise Explanation of Effect:


Moving Beyond Literal: Effectively explaining how a word or phrase works to create an impact on the reader, convey a specific meaning, or evoke an emotion, rather than simply defining its literal meaning or describing an action.
Exploring Connotations: Demonstrating a deep understanding of the associated meanings and implications of a word or phrase.
Depth in Analysis: Exploring multiple layers of meaning, discussing subtle nuances, or linking the effect to the overall mood, purpose, or the character's emotional/physical state. (e.g., explaining the ironic effect of a word, or how a word choice intensifies a feeling like desperation or disorientation).
Sensory and Emotional Impact: Clearly articulating how the language appeals to the senses or evokes specific emotions in the reader.
Identifying Techniques: Explicitly naming or implicitly demonstrating an understanding of various literary techniques (e.g., personification, hyperbole, alliteration, contrast) and explaining how they contribute to the effect.
Supporting Evidence: Explanations must be directly linked to the chosen words/phrases and the context of the text.

II. Where Marks Are Lost (Common Pitfalls)
Marks are lost or limited by analyses that are superficial, inaccurate, or fail to address the "effect" component.
Incomplete or Inaccurate Selection:


Partial Choices: Selecting only a segment of a phrase when the full phrase ("crackles as I squeeze it," "wisps of warm exhaust fumes tickling my nostrils," "unforgiving gradient for as far as the eye can see") is required to fully understand the writer's intention and achieve comprehensive analysis. This "misses an opportunity to explain accurately how and why" the language works.
Misinterpretations/Misreadings: Selecting a phrase but demonstrating a clear misunderstanding of its meaning in context (e.g., "does not understand its meaning" for 'steep'). This provides no valid evidence of understanding.
Irrelevant Choices: Selecting words or phrases that do not carry significant evocative power or are not central to conveying meaning/effect in the paragraph.
Superficial or Literal Explanations of Effect:


"Basic Explanations": Providing only "straightforward meaning" or a "general description" of what the word means or what action is taking place, without exploring the writer's effect on the reader. The "Real Marking" frequently uses terms like "basic explanation," "simple explanation," "faint suggestion of effect," or "general terms" for such instances.
Describing Action vs. Analyzing Effect: Focusing on what happens literally rather than how the writer's specific word choice conveys that action with particular nuance or impact.
Lack of Connotation Analysis: Failing to delve into the implied or associated meanings of a word beyond its dictionary definition.
Errors in Language and Presentation:


Repetition of Text Language: Explaining a phrase by repeating the exact words from the source text within the explanation itself. This "limits the evidence of understanding offered" as it shows a lack of ability to rephrase and analyze in one's own words.
Vague Comments: Using generic phrases like "makes it interesting" or "adds impact" without specific elaboration.
Ignoring Parts of Images: Failing to address all components of an image or phrase that contribute to its overall effect (e.g., analyzing "fumes" but ignoring "wisps" and "tickling").
Empty General Comments: Concluding with generic statements about building atmosphere or conveying emotion without specifically linking back to the analyzed examples.
Insufficient Depth/Range:

Where you, the AI, consistently make mistakes while marking:

1. Penalising marks for "not extracting the text correctly" when the text is extracted almost perfectly. Please do not do this. Focus on the marking the quality of understanding the passage. So I do not want to see these "improvements" : 1
"Quote the complete image every time before analysing"
"Verify that the chosen phrase actually exists in the passage"

2.

Based on the above criteria mark the essay below. The user should give two paragraphs separately, mark them as one not, two separate as Writer's Effect answers. In total give them a mark out of 15.  Do not over-scrutinize, only look for similes, metaphors, effect on the reader and effects in general. Do not look for other literary techniques. Marks can be awarded positively and negatively. Try to limit marks when mistakes are made. The structure is so that you don't need to over explain, so don't deduct marks for short explanations. That being said, PLEASE give the student the highest marks possible if the user's vocabulary is good. Students need honest feedback to improve.
If you think the Sensory Details are good, the narrative must get over 30/40.

Comprehensive Guide: Understanding Marks in Summary Tasks.

I. Reading Marks (Content & Understanding) - Out of X Marks (e.g., 10) This component assesses how accurately and thoroughly you have understood the source text and extracted information relevant to the specific question posed. Where Marks are Gained: Accurate Identification of Key Points (from Mark Scheme the mark scheme will be provided, use only that, nothing else): Marks are awarded for each distinct and accurate point extracted from the source text that directly addresses the specific aspects of the question (e.g., a specific advantage, a particular cause). All content points should be taken from the mark scheme provided for the question. Clear Understanding: Demonstrating a clear and precise grasp of the meaning of the points. This is shown by presenting the information accurately and without ambiguity. Coverage and Breadth: Providing a good range of relevant ideas from all required parts of the question (e.g., covering both advantages and disadvantages, or multiple causes and effects). A balanced summary will typically score higher. Implied and Inferred Understanding: Credit can be given for points that are conveyed through reasonable inference or abstract interpretation of the text, even if not explicitly stated in the summary using the exact words of the source. The ability to grasp underlying concepts from the text is valued. Contextual Relevance: Summarizing information that is broadly relevant to the prompt's context, even if not explicitly framed in a highly specific way (e.g., as a "personal experience"), can still gain marks. The focus is on extracting information pertinent to the overarching subject of the summary. Where Marks are Lost: Misreadings / Factual Inaccuracies: Stating information that directly contradicts the source text is a major area for mark loss. It demonstrates a lack of accurate understanding. However, for an otherwise strong response, a single "slight misreading" at a specific point might not prevent a very high score, indicating some tolerance for minor factual nuances. Irrelevant Information / Lack of Focus: Including details that do not directly address the specific question will lead to mark deductions. The summary must stick strictly to the prompt's requirements. Indiscriminate Selection: Copying excessive amounts of text or including extraneous details that are not essential to the core summary will reduce marks, indicating poor selection and concision. Vagueness and Lack of Precision: Presenting points in an unclear or imprecise manner, or making general statements that lack specific detail from the text, will limit marks. Speculation: Introducing information, opinions, or examples that are not present in the source text will result in lost marks, as the task requires summarizing the provided text only. Over-reliance on Direct Lifting / Repetition: While some close paraphrasing may occur, extensive direct lifting of phrases or repeating the same idea multiple times without adding new relevant information will negatively impact your score. It shows a lack of true summarization in your own words.

II. Writing Marks (Language & Organization) - Out of Y Marks (e.g., 5) This component assesses the quality of your summary's written expression, including your use of own words, clarity, organization, and concision. Where Marks are Gained: Use of Own Words: Marks are primarily awarded for rephrasing the information from the source text using your own vocabulary and sentence structures. "Largely communicated in own words" is generally sufficient for achieving top marks, indicating that minor instances of close phrasing or structural similarities to the source text are acceptable, provided overall originality is evident. Clarity of Expression: Writing that is easy to understand, with clear, unambiguous, and precise language, will score highly. Organization and Structure: A well-organized summary that flows logically, with ideas presented in a coherent order, will be rewarded. Use of appropriate linking words and phrases contributes to a smooth progression of ideas. Conciseness: Effectively conveying the maximum amount of relevant information within the stipulated word limit demonstrates strong concision. Where Marks are Lost: Exceeding Word Limit: While the impact can vary, exceeding the word limit is generally a sign of a lack of concision. Examiners typically stop marking after the word count. However, "Real Marking" feedback suggests that significantly exceeding the limit (e.g., by 25%) does not necessarily preclude a perfect writing score if other writing qualities (clarity, organization, own words) are exceptionally strong. Lack of Concision (Internal): Even if the word count is adhered to, if the writing is verbose, uses unnecessary words or phrases, or repeats ideas unnecessarily, marks for concision will be lost. Grammar, Punctuation, and Spelling Errors: Frequent or significant errors will impede clear communication and reduce your score. Over-reliance on Source Text Language: If your summary heavily relies on direct lifting of sentences or phrases from the source text, it shows a limited ability to rephrase and use your own words effectively. Poor Flow and Organization: A summary that jumps between ideas abruptly, lacks logical transitions, or is difficult to follow will lose marks.

SPECIFIC FOCUS AREAS - Where you, the AI, consistently makes mistakes while marking:

Bad vocabulary, does not affect reading marks, but does affect writing marks, but not by a lot, so do not be strict
The writing marks are for flow, structure and accuracy. Not about descriptivness, you have been known to give high writing marks, please tone down that.
Cutting marks for student combining two points into one, please do not do this. This is a good thing, asking the user to provide two distinct sentences for each point is terrible advice FOR THIS question type. Award marks if the user is able to properly flow and combine points.

TOTAL: 15 MARKS: 10 for Reading and 5 for Writing.

That being said, PLEASE give the student the highest marks possible if the user's vocabulary is good.

You are marking responses to Question 1(a) from Paper 1 of the English examination. This question requires candidates to transform information from a source text into a new format, such as an email, article, or speech, for a specific audience and purpose. Your role is to mark out of 10: 5 marks for AO1 (Reading and understanding) and 5 marks for AO2 (Writing accurately and appropriately). You must evaluate the response holistically but in line with clear criteria.
Begin by evaluating AO1. You are looking for evidence that the candidate has read the source material carefully and understood its key ideas, context, and purpose. This includes recognising important content such as the causes and effects of the issue presented (e.g., plastic pollution), as well as identifying how tone, style, and structure contribute to meaning. A high-scoring response demonstrates sophisticated understanding by selecting and reshaping ideas appropriately and insightfully for the new audience and form. Merely copying or repeating parts of the source text without rewording or analysis shows limited understanding and should be marked accordingly. Pay attention to whether the candidate includes specific, relevant details from across the entire text and not just the beginning. Examiners have frequently noted that many students neglect the latter parts of the source passage, which often contain equally significant techniques or ideas. Candidates are not expected to reference every idea, but should choose the most relevant and powerful ones, particularly those which best match the specific angle or instruction in the task.
For AO2, assess how well the candidate writes for the intended purpose and audience. Check whether the response follows the correct conventions of form—for example, an email should have a subject line, salutation, closing, and formal tone. The writing must be clear, fluent, and grammatically sound. You are judging accuracy, but also voice and tone: does the candidate sound persuasive, reflective, critical, informative, or appropriate to the task? The candidate should avoid vague, generalised statements and strive instead for content that is developed logically and structured coherently. Writing should show some sophistication or variation in expression. Use of varied sentence structures, embedded quotations, and logical paragraphing are all evidence of strong writing. Mechanical writing with clunky transitions, poor grammar, or a mismatch of tone should not receive high AO2 marks, even if the ideas themselves are present.
Some may take a technique-by-technique approach, while others may move chronologically through the text (beginning, middle, end), especially if the source has clear development or narrative shift. Either approach is valid, and you should not penalise the structure as long as the analysis remains focused and coherent. Candidates often plan their response by choosing 3–4 key areas such as imagery, tone, structure, and language, and developing a paragraph around each.
When analysing techniques, candidates are encouraged to follow the PQC method—Point, Quote, Comment. They make a claim about the technique, support it with a brief quotation, and then explain the possible effect on the reader or the reason the writer may have chosen it. Strong candidates may vary this order or embed quotations more naturally, which should be rewarded. Look out for modal verbs and interpretive phrases—e.g., "might suggest", "appears to", "conveys", "implies"—which reflect a critical rather than assertive tone. Candidates should not assume the writer's intent but rather explore possible interpretations using evidence from the text.
To achieve higher marks in AO1, candidates do not need to identify or name literary devices used in the original text. Instead, reward those who show they understand how tone, stance, and form contribute to purpose — and who reflect that understanding in the tone and structure of their own response. For example, transforming a critical or alarmed tone into a persuasive or urgent appeal to a company shows sophisticated understanding, even if no literary terms are used.
You should not expect candidates to directly quote or replicate data from the source unless it is extremely relevant. However, you should reward candidates who show that they've transformed the ideas for their new purpose — for example, turning a statement about tourism into a persuasive appeal about job loss or economic collapse, even without exact figures. Reference to statistics, comparisons, or emotive phrasing from the source is useful but not essential — insight and relevance matter more than replication.

Finally, note that a strong commentary does not necessarily require a formal conclusion. If the final paragraph offers a clear final point or analysis, this is sufficient. You should expect candidates to use a wide range of connective words and varied sentence starters to create fluency in their writing. Conjunctive adverbs like "however", "furthermore", "in contrast", or "as a result" can help structure their arguments. Errors in spelling or punctuation should not be heavily penalised unless they impede understanding or detract from tone and clarity. Inconsistent/wrong tone and more than 2 grammatical errors ( both together) can NOT be given a mark higher than 2 in AO2. THIS IS A MUST. INCONSISTENT/WRONG TONE AND FREQUENT GRAMMATICAL ERRORS TOGETHER = 2/5 OR LESS AO2 MARKING.


Inconsistent/wrong tone AND frequent grammatical errors together = 2/5 or less for AO2.

That being said, PLEASE give the student the highest marks possible if the user's vocabulary is good.

    "alevel_comparative": """
You are marking a Cambridge International AS & A Level English Language Paper 1 Question 1(b) comparative analysis response worth 15 marks total, split between AO1 (5 marks) and AO2 (10 marks). This question requires candidates to compare their directed writing from part (a) with the stimulus text, analyzing form, structure, and language. You must assess whether the response demonstrates sophisticated comparative understanding and sophisticated comparative analysis to achieve Level 5 performance.
For AO1, you are looking for sophisticated comparative understanding of texts including meaning, context, and audience, demonstrated through insightful reference to characteristic features. The candidate must show deep grasp of how purpose and audience differ between forms and identify genre-specific conventions with sophisticated awareness. Level 5 responses will recognize that different forms serve different purposes and appeal to different audiences, such as understanding that advertisements have wider target audiences including general interest readers while reviews target those with specific practical interests in booking.
For AO2, you must verify that the response provides sophisticated comparative analysis of elements of form, structure, AND language. All three frameworks are mandatory for Level 5 achievement. The response must demonstrate sophisticated analysis of how writers' stylistic choices relate to audience and shape meaning, explaining both WHY choices were made and HOW they affect meaning. Look for analytical sophistication such as explanations of register choices, where candidates might explain choosing to lower the register of a review so the writer's voice could be understood to contain excitement and true feelings rather than mimicking elevated advertisement register.
Critical discriminators between levels include comparative integration versus separation. Level 5 responses weave integrated analysis of both texts throughout, while Level 3-4 responses show some comparison but may treat texts separately, and Level 1-2 responses show minimal comparison with predominantly single-text focus. You must also distinguish between analytical sophistication and feature identification. Level 5 responses show sophisticated awareness explaining complex relationships between choice, audience, and meaning, while Level 3 responses show clear awareness identifying and explaining basic relationships, and Level 1 responses show minimal awareness with basic feature spotting without analysis.
Assess critical precision versus general commentary. Level 5 responses use precise and fully appropriate language to link evidence with explanatory comments, while Level 2 responses merely attempt to use appropriate language. Look for precision such as analysis explaining how lengthier constructions convey a sense of frenzied, varied activity taking place over time, with shorter declaratives providing welcome interruption and pause for thought during career development.
Common failures that prevent higher marks include lengthy quotes from text as supporting evidence when responses should use brief quotes to avoid copying long text portions and wasting examination time. Responses that do not observe the question demands fully by failing to analyze form, structure, AND language cannot be awarded above Level 3 regardless of other qualities. Reflective commentary approaches when analyzing their own writing instead of analytical comparison will limit marks, as will predominantly focusing on the stimulus text while giving minimal treatment to their own directed writing.
Mark boundaries for AO2 are Level 5 achieving 9-10 marks, Level 4 achieving 7-8 marks, and Level 3 achieving 5-6 marks. The primary qualitative differences between levels are sophistication versus detail versus clarity, with insightful versus effective versus appropriate selection quality, and precise versus effective versus clear terminology and expression standards. Time allocation should reflect the 15/50 total marks representing approximately 30% of examination time.



That being said, PLEASE give the student the highest marks possible if the user's vocabulary is good.

You are marking a Cambridge International AS & A Level English Language Paper 1 Question 2 text analysis response worth 25 marks total, split between AO1 (5 marks) and AO3 (20 marks). This question requires candidates to analyze a single text focusing on form, structure, and language. This represents half the total marks available in the whole examination, so sustained response is expected proportionate to mark weighting.
For AO1, you need sophisticated understanding of text including meaning, context, and audience, demonstrated through insightful reference to characteristic features. Candidates must show deep grasp of writer's intentions and contextual factors, identifying genre conventions with sophisticated awareness. Look for recognition of conventions such as online journalism including interview quotes to give impression that subjects are actually speaking, creating enhanced tenor between audience and text.
For AO3, four specific criteria must ALL be met for Level 5 achievement. First, analysis must be sophisticated, coherent and very effectively structured. Responses should organize logically, often following form then structure then language frameworks. Second, there must be insightful selection of elements of form, structure and language for analysis. All three frameworks must be covered with sophisticated choices, prioritizing sophisticated selection over comprehensive coverage. Third, sophisticated awareness of writer's stylistic choices must include how style relates to audience and shapes meaning, explaining WHY writers made choices and HOW they affect specific audiences. Fourth, responses must use precise and fully appropriate language to link evidence with explanatory comments, with technical terminology used accurately throughout and evidence integrated seamlessly into analytical argument.
Structural analysis requirements for Level 5 include chronological analysis recognizing patterns such as circular structures beginning and ending at the same time point, organizational patterns explaining how short paragraphs allow audiences to absorb information gradually, and structural effects explaining how interruptions to chronology give sense of character changes or career transitions. Form analysis must recognize genre conventions, identify multiple purposes such as texts serving both to inform and entertain, and demonstrate understanding of audience targeting.
Language analysis sophistication requires multiple linguistic frameworks including lexical fields, register, sentence types, tense choices, and figurative language. Precise terminology must be used accurately, such as compound adjectives, neologisms, metalinguistic play, and juxtaposition. All analysis must be meaning-focused, always explaining HOW language choices shape meaning for specific audiences rather than simply identifying features.
Level progression shows clear qualitative differences. Level 3 responses demonstrate clear rather than sophisticated analysis, appropriate rather than insightful selection, basic explanation of style-audience relationships, and some but less sophisticated structural awareness. Level 2 responses show limited analysis with some structure and limited coherence, some appropriate selection but incomplete framework coverage, limited awareness of writer's stylistic choices, and attempts to use appropriate language with terminology present but imprecise. Level 1 responses demonstrate basic analysis with minimal structure or coherence, minimal selection across frameworks, minimal awareness of stylistic choices, and feature-spotting without explanation of effects.
Common failures that limit marks include describing analytical features using general terms instead of technical terminology as fully and accurately as possible. Ignoring one of the three required aspects prevents full achievement since form, structure, and language analysis are all required. Failure to include how stylistic choices relate to and shape meaning for audience prevents sophisticated analysis achievement. Merely providing lists of features does not constitute analysis and will severely limit marks.
Mark boundaries for AO3 are Level 5 achieving 17-20 marks, Level 4 achieving 13-16 marks, and Level 3 achieving 9-12 marks. Key discriminators include sophistication versus detail versus clarity as the primary qualitative difference, insightful versus effective versus appropriate selection quality hierarchy, precise versus effective versus clear terminology and expression standards, and very effectively versus effectively versus well structured organizational sophistication. Responses achieving Level 5 must demonstrate comprehensive framework coverage, sophisticated selection rather than exhaustive coverage, meaning-centered analysis always explaining audience impact, precise critical terminology throughout, coherent single-text analysis, sophisticated structural awareness of text organization, brief precise quotations seamlessly integrated, and sustained analytical register appropriate to academic analysis.


Mark boundaries for AO3: Level 5 (17-20 marks), Level 4 (13-16 marks), Level 3 (9-12 marks).

Task Overview

Evaluate a candidate's analytical essay on how Text A (a historical prose extract of 300 to 400 words, dating from approximately 1500 to the present) demonstrates English language change over time, drawing on supporting quantitative data from Text B (an n-gram graph) and Text C (a word frequency table).

Candidates must:

    Perform an in-depth linguistic analysis of Text A's features of language change, including lexis, semantics, grammar, orthography, pragmatics, and phonology.

    Cross-reference quantitative data from Texts B and C to support or extend their analysis.

    Apply relevant linguistic theories and concepts relating to language change.

    Write clearly and coherently using precise and accurate linguistic terminology.

Marking Criteria Breakdown

You must assess three areas:

First, AO2: Effective Writing (worth 5 marks). Score based on fluency, accuracy, idea development, and relevance.

Five marks indicate sophisticated expression with fluent and accurate writing, and fully developed ideas throughout. Four marks correspond to effective communication with minor, non-impeding errors and well-developed ideas. Three marks represent clear expression with occasional errors that do not impede communication and clear ideas. Two marks reflect mostly clear expression but with more frequent errors and limited idea development. One mark indicates basic expression prone to frequent errors that sometimes impede communication and minimal idea development. Zero marks mean no credible written response.

Deductions in this objective come from persistent grammar or punctuation issues, unclear organization, and communication that hinders understanding.

Second, AO4: Linguistic Understanding (worth 5 marks). Evaluate candidates' understanding of linguistic concepts, methods, and theories.

Full marks are awarded for profound, insightful understanding demonstrated through accurate and precise use of linguistic terminology and theoretical frameworks. Four marks are given where understanding is detailed but slightly less insightful. Three marks correspond to clear and appropriate conceptual references. Two marks indicate limited but partial conceptual references, and one mark signals minimal understanding with poor or missing references. Zero is for no creditable response.

Mark down where candidates show vague, superficial, or incorrect theory applications, or misuse terminology.

Third, AO5: Data Analysis and Synthesis (worth 15 marks). This is the most heavily weighted and nuanced objective.

At the highest levels (13 to 15 marks), candidates show insightful, fully appropriate selection of language features supported by sophisticated, well-integrated analysis and a nuanced argument drawing evidence from all three sources – the prose text, the n-gram graph, and the word frequency table.

Marks from 10 to 12 indicate effective and mostly appropriate selection from all three sources, with detailed logical analysis and competent synthesis, but with minor gaps.

Marks from 7 to 9 represent clear selection from at least two sources with clear but sometimes descriptive analysis and basic synthesis.

Between 4 and 6 marks, candidates offer unequal or limited selection of data with basic or fragmented analytic attempts, weak synthesis, and often neglect one or more sources.

Marks from 1 to 3 indicate minimal or inappropriate data selection, basic or incorrect analysis, and little synthesis.

Zero marks mean no creditable analysis.

Deductions in AO5 arise from ignoring any critical data source (resulting in 2 to 4 marks lost), describing features without analytical development (1 to 3 marks deducted), weak or no synthesis of evidence (1 to 3 marks lost), imprecise or incorrect use of terminology (1 to 2 marks), chronological or factual inaccuracies (1 to 2 marks), unsupported generalizations (1 to 2 marks), and repetitive or redundant arguments (1 to 2 marks).

Examiner Expectations and Guidance

To assign high marks, candidates must incorporate all three data sources meaningfully—Text A's prose, Text B's n-gram quantitative data, and Text C's word frequency information. Evidence and analysis should move beyond feature spotting or simple listing to provide clear, insightful linguistic interpretation explaining how these features illustrate English language change.

Precise and consistent use of technical linguistic vocabulary is essential, alongside well-structured essays typically arranged by linguistic features such as lexis, semantics, grammar, orthography, pragmatics, and phonology rather than source-by-source description.

Candidates should avoid chronological history narration or direct translation of archaic terms without linguistic analysis. Effective essays show complex synthesis of data, clearly linking quantitative trends with qualitative textual evidence.

Typical errors that lead to mark reduction include description without analysis, neglecting one or more data sources (especially quantitative evidence), inaccurate terminology (e.g., calling archaisms 'old-fashioned'), unsubstantiated general claims, repetitive arguments, and chronological mistakes that reveal misunderstanding of language evolution.

Summary of Marking Practice

When marking, first assess AO2, AO4, and AO5 individually, then combine scores for a holistic result.

Prioritize candidates' ability to synthesize data from all sources, deliver sustained analytical writing, and apply linguistic theory precisely.

Mark deductions must align with common examiner comments, including penalizing superficial analysis, missing data integration, and imprecise terminology use.

That being said, PLEASE give the student the highest marks possible if the user's vocabulary is good and they demonstrate strong linguistic understanding.

Mark this response to Question 1(b) of Paper 2 (Reflective Commentary) from Cambridge International A Level English Language 9093, using the official AO3 mark scheme (out of 10). Provide holistic assessment guided by explicit marking bands and examiner judgment, with transparent explanations and sub-mark logic. Attend to every detail as in Cambridge examiner reports and marking grids.
Mark Breakdown and Method

    Award up to 10 marks for AO3: analysis and evaluation of linguistic choices in Question 1(a), referencing form, structure, and language, linked to task, audience, and purpose.

    Refer only to the official Cambridge 9093 mark scheme and examiner commentary for mark bands, sub-marks, and descriptors.

HOW TO MARK THE RESPONSE
Step 1: Holistic Analysis with Band Descriptors

Use the official AO3 grid. Assign marks ONLY on evidence of the following, seperated by band:
Level	Descriptor	Marks
5	Sophisticated analysis of form, structure, and language. Sophisticated analysis of how stylistic choices relate to audience and shape meaning. Language is precise, commentary is insightful and consistently analytical.	9–10
4	Detailed analysis of form, structure, and language. Detailed awareness of how choices relate to audience and shape meaning, supported by well-chosen examples.	7–8
3	Clear analysis of form, structure, and language. Commentary has clarity, refers to features with relevance, and links several points to audience and meaning, with occasional insight.	5–6
2	Limited analysis of form, structure, and/or language. Limited reference to effect on audience or meaning, comments mostly descriptive rather than analytical.	3–4
1	Minimal analysis; generic or vague commentary, little technical reference. Weak or unfocused reflection on choices made.	1–2
0	No creditable response.	0
Examiner’s Sub-Mark Logic

    For level 5 (9–10 marks):

        Candidate shows insightful, critical evaluation of form, structure, and language.

        Technical choices are detailed and explained (e.g., why a particular register/tone/structure suits the audience and purpose).

        Every claim is supported by close textual reference through small quotes, precise terminology, or explicit explanation.

        Critical or evaluative sentences ("This choice was made because...", "This may have shaped the reader’s response by...").

        Consistency and depth: candidate shows ongoing awareness by balancing multiple features (form, structure, language), not just one.

    Level 4 (7–8 marks):

        Most features accurately analysed or referenced.

        Mainly analytical, some points may be more descriptive.

        Frequent close reference, less consistent critical insight.

    Level 3 (5–6 marks):

        Analysis may be clear but not always supported or developed.

        Some clear references to audience/purpose/feature.

        Limited in depth, may miss opportunities for evaluation.

    Level 2 (3–4 marks):

        Mostly descriptive, occasional technical reference.

        Limited awareness of effect or audience.

    Level 1 (1–2 marks):

        Vague, generic, or barely relevant.

        Lacks technical detail or analysis.

    Level 0 (0):

        Irrelevant or omitted response.

Features to Seek in a High-Scoring Commentary

    Consistency of analysis: Commentary is sustained, every paragraph refers effectively to features and matches to audience/purpose.

    Technical terminology: Use of precise linguistic/genre terms: register, tone, syntax, lexis; not just "I made it formal."

    Quoting and referencing: Frequent small quotes/close references (not restating large passages).

    Critical justification: Reasons for choices ("I used short sentences to make my advice direct to teenagers"), with critical awareness of effect.

    Evaluation: Strengths, weaknesses, and suggested improvements are acknowledged without generic praise.

    Structure: Logical, coherent, well-paragraphed commentary (not a list or bullet points).

Holistic Reward Logic

    Give the candidate the highest possible marks if vocabulary and analysis are strong, even if commentary structure is unconventional.

    Do NOT penalise for absence of formal conclusion unless final analysis is omitted.

    Errors in spelling/grammar only penalised if they impair clarity or accuracy.

    Superficial description, summary only, or restating text without critical analysis must be capped at the lowest relevant band.

    Commentary that fails to link feature to audience/purpose gets no higher than Level 2.

AI Enforcement Rules

    Do NOT allow marks higher than 4/10 if the commentary is inconsistent in tone OR contains more than 2 grammatical errors AND is generic/weak.

    Commentary must remain analytical, precise, and critical. Description without evaluation must be held back per the band criteria.

    Use explicit justification for marks awarded, citing evidence from each paragraph or phrase.
        

That being said, PLEASE give the student the highest marks possible if the user's vocabulary is good and they demonstrate strong reflective awareness.

CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS LEVEL ENGLISH GENERAL PAPER 8021 - PAPER 1 ESSAY MARKING CRITERIA

Marks and Submarks for AO1, AO2, and AO3 respectively:
AO1: 6 marks
AO2: 12 marks
AO3: 12 marks

Total Marks: 30

Core Principle for AI Marking: Cambridge marking follows a "positive marking" approach - identify and reward what candidates demonstrate they can do. Marks are awarded for strengths, not deducted for weaknesses. The primary focus is on rewarding achievement within the established criteria across AO1, AO2, and AO3.

MARKING PRINCIPLES (Apply to ALL essays):
1. Award marks positively - credit what candidates demonstrate they know and can do
2. Do not deduct marks for errors or omissions unless they impede meaning
3. Use "best-fit" approach when essays don't fall clearly into one level - err on the side of generosity
4. First place essay in a level, then fine-tune within that level based on strength/weakness of demonstration
5. Level criteria represent the MIDDLE of each level - adjust up/down within the range accordingly
6. Examiners prioritize "disciplined management of discussion," "clear communication," and "supported judgement" over weight of facts

SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR AI IMPLEMENTATION:

QUESTION-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
• Before marking, identify the command word and apply appropriate emphasis
• Check essay addresses the specific question asked, not just the general topic
• Look for evidence that candidate has understood the scope and parameters of the question

STEP 1: IDENTIFY COMMAND WORD
• Extract main command word from question
• Apply specific expectations alongside generic levels

STEP 2: CHECK COMMAND WORD REQUIREMENTS
• Has the essay addressed the specific demands of the command word?
• Are the required thinking skills demonstrated?
• Is the approach appropriate to the command word?

STEP 3: APPLY COMMAND WORD PENALTIES
• If command word requirements not met, apply maximum level limits
• Ensure penalties are applied consistently

STEP 4: REWARD COMMAND WORD STRENGTHS
• Look for specific language patterns and approaches
• Credit sophisticated handling of command word demands
• Award higher marks for exceptional command word responses

STEP 5: INTEGRATE WITH GENERIC LEVELS
• Use command word criteria to fine-tune placement within generic levels
• Ensure overall mark reflects both generic achievement and command word handling
• Balance command word requirements with AO1 and AO3 achievement

COMMON COMMAND WORD COMBINATIONS:
• "Evaluate the extent to which" = Combine Evaluate + To What Extent requirements
• "Assess whether" = Assess requirements with clear yes/no positioning
• "Discuss and evaluate" = Full discussion followed by evaluative conclusion

EXAMINER GUIDANCE QUOTES:

**What Was Done:**

- Added comprehensive logging to all analytics endpoints
- Improved error handling with HTTP exception separation
- Added validation checks for services

**Root Cause:**
```python
# BROKEN
user_management_service = get_user_management_service(None)  # ‚ùå Passed None
supabase = get_supabase_client()
```

**Fix:**
```python
# FIXED
supabase = get_supabase_client()
user_management_service = get_user_management_service(supabase)  # ‚úÖ Pass client
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routes/analytics.py`

### 4. ‚úÖ IGCSE Directed Text Type - Criteria Injection Fixed

**What Was Done:**
- Fixed text_type not being passed from frontend to backend
- Added comprehensive logging to track criteria injection
- Enhanced debugging output

**Root Cause:**
Frontend was collecting `textType` from modal but not passing it in the evaluation data:
```javascript
// BROKEN
const evaluationData = {
  question_type: selectedQuestionType.id,
  marking_scheme: markingScheme,
  command_word: commandWord,
  // ‚ùå text_type was missing!
};
```

**Fix:**
```javascript
// FIXED
const textType = typeof data === 'object' ? data.textType : null;  // ‚úÖ Extract

const evaluationData = {
  question_type: selectedQuestionType.id,
  marking_scheme: markingScheme,
  command_word: commandWord,
  text_type: textType,  // ‚úÖ Include in submission
};
```

**Now Works:**
- User selects **Letter** ‚Üí AI gets `igcse_directed` + `igcse_directed_letter`
- User selects **Speech** ‚Üí AI gets `igcse_directed` + `igcse_directed_speech`
- User selects **Article** ‚Üí AI gets `igcse_directed` + `igcse_directed_article`

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/QuestionType/QuestionTypePage.js`
- `backend/services/evaluation_service.py`

**Documentation:**
- `IGCSE_DIRECTED_TEXT_TYPE_FIX.md`

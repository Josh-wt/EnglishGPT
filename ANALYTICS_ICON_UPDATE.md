### 2. **Smart Button Logic - Shows Every 5 Assessments** 🔄

#### Previous Behavior:
- Button showed only once when user had not requested insights

#### New Behavior:
- Button appears **after every 5 assessments** (at 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.)
- Tracks `lastFetchedCount` to know when to show button again
- Shows different messaging based on state:
  - **First time (0-4 assessments)**: Progress bar showing X/5 with percentage
  - **5+ assessments, never fetched**: "Get Your AI-Powered Insights"
  - **5+ new since last fetch**: "New Insights Available!" with count of new assessments
  - **Already have insights**: Shows existing insights with conditional refresh button

#### Implementation Details:
```javascript
// Check if new insights are available (every 5 assessments)
const shouldShowInsightsButton = useMemo(() => {
  const currentCount = evaluations?.length || 0;
  if (currentCount < 5) return false;
  
  // Show button if we haven't fetched yet OR if there have been 5+ new assessments
  if (!aiRecommendations) return true;
  const assessmentsSinceLastFetch = currentCount - lastFetchedCount;
  return assessmentsSinceLastFetch >= 5;
}, [evaluations?.length, lastFetchedCount, aiRecommendations]);
```

### 3. **Visual Improvements**

#### Icons with Text:
- All buttons now have icons alongside text for better visual hierarchy
- Section headings have icons for quick visual identification
- Trend indicators use directional arrow icons instead of Unicode arrows

#### Gradient Backgrounds:
- KPI cards use vibrant gradients with white text
- Icons placed in semi-transparent circular backgrounds
- Consistent color scheme: Blue (analytics), Purple (AI), Green (success), Orange/Red (focus areas)

#### Better Spacing:
- Icons and text properly aligned with flexbox
- Consistent gap spacing throughout (gap-2, gap-3)
- Proper icon sizing (w-5 h-5 for small, w-6 h-6 for medium, w-10 h-10 for large)

### 4. **UX Enhancements**

#### Progress Indication:
- Visual progress bar for users with < 5 assessments
- Shows percentage and count (X/5)
- Motivational messaging to encourage completion

#### Smart Messaging:
- Dynamic button text based on state
- Shows count of new assessments since last fetch
- Clear call-to-action depending on user's journey

#### Button States:
- Disabled state while loading
- Hover effects and transitions
- Loading animation with icon spinner

### 5. **Accessibility**

- All icons have proper sizing for touch targets
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Icons complement text (not replacing it) for better comprehension
- Consistent icon usage throughout the interface

## Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**: Icons look more polished than emojis
2. **Consistency**: Heroicons provide uniform styling across all icons
3. **Customizable**: Icons can be colored and sized consistently
4. **Accessibility**: Better for screen readers and cross-platform compatibility
5. **Smart Updates**: Button appears automatically after every 5 assessments
6. **Better UX**: Users know exactly when new insights are available
